trackc - track view of chromosome conformation and multi-omics data
===================================================================

**trackc** is a Python Package to Flexible Visualization of 3D Genome and Multiomics.
It builds on top of `matplotlib`, from which it allows for flexible adjustments.

TrackC's key applications
--------------------------
- Mark the abnormal interaction formed by the structural variation of the genome.
- Show the three-dimensional genome interaction and multi-omics data after rearrangement.
- Flexible and convenient layout for multi-track
